## Usage:

It's possible to build a diagram from a single class or an interface,
a JavaScript or a TypeScript file and from a whole directory.
To create a diagram you could use an item called **Diagrams** in a context menu,
and then select a **JavaScript and TypeScript Classes** diagram type.

More details could be found in the IntelliJ diagrams [docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/class-diagram.html).
